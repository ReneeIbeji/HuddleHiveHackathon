## Who are we?

 We are Pink Bees, the team behind Thrive Tribe. We're a mix of developers, designers and product managers. Our product manager Emma, leads the team helping us stay on track. Our resident designer Ana was responsible for designing the UI, from the application screens to accessibility concerns. The developers, Renee, Zeinab and Millie worked tirelessly to code a prototype of our wonderful application.

## Thrive Tribe

 In our day-to-day lives it is sometimes easy to forget to mundane, smaller goals that we set ourselves. Without a support system it is even harder to stick to your goals, especially in a bustling city like London.

 That's where Thrive Tribe comes in. Thrive Tribe provides users with a virtual specialised community of individuals with common goals, making it easier and more enjoyable to stay on track each day. With gamified features such as a leaderboard and automated encouraging or celebratory messages (depending on where the individual is with their progress), Thrive Tribe also rewards engagement helping the communities truly thrive.

## Tech Stack

 Our prototype used simple yet sophisticated technologies, with HTML and CSS for the front-end and ReactJS for both front and back-end. Ideally, we would also use NodeJS for back-end and MongoDB for the database.

The [project codebase](https://github.com/ReneeIbeji/HuddleHiveHackathon) was composed with the following list of technologies:

| Language | % of Codebase |

| JavaScript | 72.9 |

| CSS | 15 |

| HTML | 12.1 |

## Accomplishments

As a team of mostly newbies, we are super proud of each of our members for putting so much work and embracing the experience of the hackathon both technically and socially. 

We succeeded getting through many merge conflicts, which in the moment felt like an immense challenge!

 For some individuals in the team, these languages were new, so they were learning as they coded.
